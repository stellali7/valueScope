# VALUEscope: Unveiling Implicit Norms and Values via Return Potential Model of Social Interactions

## Project Overview
VALUEscope is a computational framework that leverages language models to quantify social norms and values within online communities. The project is grounded in social science perspectives on normative structures and utilizes a novel Return Potential Model (RPM) to dissect and analyze linguistic and stylistic expressions across various digital platforms.
