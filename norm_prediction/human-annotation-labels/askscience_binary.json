Since my major pertains specifically to environmental science I have found myself looking into ways that I may put myself on track to be involved in either policymaking or regulatory oversight in the future but i find myself wary of the growing distrust and conspiratorial mindset against accepting scientific consensus particularly here in America. I'm sure for most people bothering to browse this sub you have been exposed to some form of science denial in your past whether it be the result of benign ignorance or obsessive disassociation with reality but the point still stands that it happens a lot and it seems as though the gap has widened between people who work in scientific fields and those that are a part of wider society. \n\nTo the point where people have become almost brazen with their opinions that fly in the face of easily explainable and dare i say high school level concepts, being in my 20's i find it to be a bit of dice roll whether or not a person i am talking to has some rather warped ideas as to what they will and will not believe when it comes to science and i am unsure as to whether or not this is due to a proper education (i.e. the ability to comprehend scientific literature) or just willful ignorance. I've always been of the opinion that an informed public is an effective one and would like for it to be a part of my life's work to make science more synonymous with the average persons understanding so that miscommunications and mistrust are far less commonplace but I am unsure as to what the root of the problem is. Apologies for the vaguery when it comes to my reference to science i just feel as though this topic encompasses all avenues, climate denial, anti-vaxxers, people who raise the alarm on innocuous advancements that are by no means meant to be commonplace hell I've even had someone tell me in college that quantum mechanics was entirely made up and that their was no basis for it. I guess a large part of the problem is the way in which people receive their information through the media which has a tendency to sensationalize anything and everything in an effort to grab one's attention and i suppose it is unfair to expect the average person to investigate the peer-reviewed literature on their own to dissuade their suspicion but how else are you to reach people who have already made up their minds on these sort of things. An early education is a start to making these sorts of things fade away but what is to be done of the adults, young and old, of the working world? How do you reach them?",

In my country, some people dig science, but all of them are familiar with a Pledge of allegiance, the loose  concepts of national origin, and mild literacy. Because this was ground into them through daily repetition and hands-on group tasks.\n\nWith institutional pressure applied to culturally ingrain The Method, people could appreciate science for what it is discuss it more easily, increasing debate.\n\nReligion starts in the home at a young age.

I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).

And I'm solid on basic linear algebra, so I get that going to the Bravais form is really just a change of basis.  What I don't get is why we're working with a basis for the \"reciprocal space\".  I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).  But how the heck does just taking the reciprocal correspond to the Fourier transform?  And why would we even _want_ to Fourier transform in this context?",
        "comment1": "IIRC from crystallography (many moons ago) it's because you're dealing with unit cell notation. So you may have a unit cell that is, say, 4 angstroms (a direction) x 4 angstroms (b direction) x 8 angstroms (c direction). You may have a crystallographic plane that runs through (a,b/2,c/4). Rather than deal with that awkward notation, it's written (1,2,4).",

I'm also the lead on the initial Mineralogy/Petrology of the meteorites found by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN), an interdisciplinary research group that is working to uncover the mysteries surrounding solar system formation. Digital observatories, part of the DFN, monitor a third of Australian skies, all night. The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems. As a geologist, I want to know where rocks come from, along with their composition and distribution. Trying to mesh those two is kind of the holy grail in figuring out what the solar system is really like.

I\u2019m doing this AMA today to highlight how NIMH-supported research is developing knowledge that will help save lives and help reverse the rising suicide rates.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be here from 12-2 p.m. ET \u2013 Looking forward to answering your questions!  Ask Me Anything!\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs immediate support or intervention, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741). Both services are free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The Lifeline is a national network that routes your confidential and toll-free call to the nearest crisis center. These centers provide crisis counseling and mental health referrals. You can call for yourself or on behalf of a friend.  If the situation is potentially life-threatening, call 911 or go - or assist a friend to go - to a hospital emergency room. Lives have been saved by people taking action.   \n\n\nTo learn about the warning signs of suicide, action steps for supporting someone in emotional pain, and crisis helpline numbers, go to the [NIMH Suicide Prevention webpage](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/LINK).\n\nAdditionally, you can find recent suicide statistics, here: [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/LINK](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/LINK)\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for participating in our Reddit AMA today!

I'm working on strategies for our research that will help prevent suicide.\n\nSuicide claims over 47,000 lives a year in the U.S. and we urgently need better prevention and intervention strategies. Thanks to research efforts, it is now possible to identify those at-risk using evidence-based practices, and there are effective treatments currently being tested in real-world settings. I\u2019m doing this AMA today to highlight how NIMH-supported research is developing knowledge that will help save lives and help reverse the rising suicide rates.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be here from 12-2 p.m. ET \u2013 Looking forward to answering your questions!  Ask Me Anything!\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs immediate support or intervention, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741). Both services are free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The Lifeline is a national network that routes your confidential and toll-free call to the nearest crisis center. These centers provide crisis counseling and mental health referrals. You can call for yourself or on behalf of a friend.  If the situation is potentially life-threatening, call 911 or go - or assist a friend to go - to a hospital emergency room. Lives have been saved by people taking action.   \n\n\nTo learn about the warning signs of suicide, action steps for supporting someone in emotional pain, and crisis helpline numbers, go to the [NIMH Suicide Prevention webpage](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/LINK).\n\nAdditionally, you can find recent suicide statistics, here: [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/LINK](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/LINK)\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for participating in our Reddit AMA today!

Like, I can see how we can form a valid coordinate system that way, but it seems like just an unnecessary complication, when we could just use the actual axis intersection points. \n\nI've been Googling, trying to find an explanation (as my textbook gave no actual explanation of the theory, just a single example of how get the indices) and Wikipedia is the only source I've found so far that even attempts to explain the actual theory. It says that Miller indices \"denote the family of (parallel) lattice planes... orthogonal to... the basis or primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice for the given Bravais lattice.\"  I mostly understand what that's saying, but I have some questions: first, if we want to represent planes orthogonal to the basis vectors, shouldn't we be taking the _negative_ reciprocals?  Second, why do we want the planes to be perpendicular to the basis vectors in the first place?  And third, why are we working with \"the basis or primitive translation vectors of the _reciprocal lattice_\" at all?  \n\nI get why we want to \"reduce\" (not sure if that's the correct terminology) more complicated crystal structures to the 14 Bravais structures, and we studied all those structures pretty in depth when I took chem 102 last year, so I'm pretty comfortable with them.  And I'm solid on basic linear algebra, so I get that going to the Bravais form is really just a change of basis.  What I don't get is why we're working with a basis for the \"reciprocal space\".  I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).  But how the heck does just taking the reciprocal correspond to the Fourier transform?  And why would we even _want_ to Fourier transform in this context?",

On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/LINK\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

        "description1": "I've been grappling a lot of with the issue of scientific literacy especially after what we have seen with the pandemic shining a light on the view of the scientific consensus along with the fact that i have several times had to explain what i would have thought to be basic concepts like how vaccines work or debunking conspiracy theories family members bring up in casual conversation that seem to arise out of a fundamental misunderstanding of one or more topics.\n\nI have recently graduated from university and while I am in the midst of planning out what my next move will be I have been confronted with what I would like to do with my career as it evolves over time. Since my major pertains specifically to environmental science I have found myself looking into ways that I may put myself on track to be involved in either policymaking or regulatory oversight in the future but i find myself wary of the growing distrust and conspiratorial mindset against accepting scientific consensus particularly here in America. I'm sure for most people bothering to browse this sub you have been exposed to some form of science denial in your past whether it be the result of benign ignorance or obsessive disassociation with reality but the point still stands that it happens a lot and it seems as though the gap has widened between people who work in scientific fields and those that are a part of wider society. \n\nTo the point where people have become almost brazen with their opinions that fly in the face of easily explainable and dare i say high school level concepts, being in my 20's i find it to be a bit of dice roll whether or not a person i am talking to has some rather warped ideas as to what they will and will not believe when it comes to science and i am unsure as to whether or not this is due to a proper education (i.e. the ability to comprehend scientific literature) or just willful ignorance. I've always been of the opinion that an informed public is an effective one and would like for it to be a part of my life's work to make science more synonymous with the average persons understanding so that miscommunications and mistrust are far less commonplace but I am unsure as to what the root of the problem is. Apologies for the vaguery when it comes to my reference to science i just feel as though this topic encompasses all avenues, climate denial, anti-vaxxers, people who raise the alarm on innocuous advancements that are by no means meant to be commonplace hell I've even had someone tell me in college that quantum mechanics was entirely made up and that their was no basis for it. I guess a large part of the problem is the way in which people receive their information through the media which has a tendency to sensationalize anything and everything in an effort to grab one's attention and i suppose it is unfair to expect the average person to investigate the peer-reviewed literature on their own to dissuade their suspicion but how else are you to reach people who have already made up their minds on these sort of things. An early education is a start to making these sorts of things fade away but what is to be done of the adults, young and old, of the working world? How do you reach them?",
        "comment1": "I find few children understand the principles of Scientific Method, few adults understand it feels, and many don't undersrand it all. \n\nThere is no wand to wave and fix the issue you address immediately. What does work broadly, however, is brainwashing or implanting the concepts of something and a young age. In my country, some people dig science, but all of them are familiar with a Pledge of allegiance, the loose  concepts of national origin, and mild literacy. Because this was ground into them through daily repetition and hands-on group tasks.\n\nWith institutional pressure applied to culturally ingrain The Method, people could appreciate science for what it is discuss it more easily, increasing debate.\n\nReligion starts in the home at a young age. Many religious tropes are bizarre (compared to our daily experiences) or just so abstract that they wouldn't fly if they had to wait til adulthood to be considered.",

        "description1": "Hi, Reddit! My name is Jane Pearson, and I am from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). I'm working on strategies for our research that will help prevent suicide.\n\nSuicide claims over 47,000 lives a year in the U.S. and we urgently need better prevention and intervention strategies. Thanks to research efforts, it is now possible to identify those at-risk using evidence-based practices, and there are effective treatments currently being tested in real-world settings. I\u2019m doing this AMA today to highlight how NIMH-supported research is developing knowledge that will help save lives and help reverse the rising suicide rates.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be here from 12-2 p.m. ET \u2013 Looking forward to answering your questions!  Ask Me Anything!\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs immediate support or intervention, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741). Both services are free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The Lifeline is a national network that routes your confidential and toll-free call to the nearest crisis center. These centers provide crisis counseling and mental health referrals. You can call for yourself or on behalf of a friend.  If the situation is potentially life-threatening, call 911 or go - or assist a friend to go - to a hospital emergency room. Lives have been saved by people taking action.   \n\n\nTo learn about the warning signs of suicide, action steps for supporting someone in emotional pain, and crisis helpline numbers, go to the [NIMH Suicide Prevention webpage](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/LINK).\n\nAdditionally, you can find recent suicide statistics, here: [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/LINK](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/LINK)\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for participating in our Reddit AMA today! Please continue the conversation and share your thoughts. We will post a recap of this AMA on the NIMH website later. Check back soon! www.nimh.nih.gov.\n\nTo learn more about NIMH research and to find resources on suicide prevention, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/suicideprevention.",

        "description1": "An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/LINK\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

Like, I can see how we can form a valid coordinate system that way, but it seems like just an unnecessary complication, when we could just use the actual axis intersection points. \n\nI've been Googling, trying to find an explanation (as my textbook gave no actual explanation of the theory, just a single example of how get the indices) and Wikipedia is the only source I've found so far that even attempts to explain the actual theory. It says that Miller indices \"denote the family of (parallel) lattice planes... orthogonal to... the basis or primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice for the given Bravais lattice.\"  I mostly understand what that's saying, but I have some questions: first, if we want to represent planes orthogonal to the basis vectors, shouldn't we be taking the _negative_ reciprocals?  Second, why do we want the planes to be perpendicular to the basis vectors in the first place?  And third, why are we working with \"the basis or primitive translation vectors of the _reciprocal lattice_\" at all?  \n\nI get why we want to \"reduce\" (not sure if that's the correct terminology) more complicated crystal structures to the 14 Bravais structures, and we studied all those structures pretty in depth when I took chem 102 last year, so I'm pretty comfortable with them.  And I'm solid on basic linear algebra, so I get that going to the Bravais form is really just a change of basis.  What I don't get is why we're working with a basis for the \"reciprocal space\".  I looked at the Wikipedia article on that subject and it mentioned that the reciprocal lattice is the Fourier transform of the original lattice -- and alright, I've work with Fourier transforms and similar integral transforms before and I know it can sometimes be simpler to do an integral transform, perform the relevant computation, than get the inverse transform from a table (or a CAS, such as Wolfram Alpha).  But how the heck does just taking the reciprocal correspond to the Fourier transform?  And why would we even _want_ to Fourier transform in this context?",

        "comment2": "Radiation is essentially any energy transfer that doesn't occur by conduction or convection. The entire light spectrum falls into this category (hence the term \"Electro-magnetic Radiation\"). What you're looking for is a subset of radiation called Ionizing Radiation. Ionizing radiation is radiation that is energetic enough to separate electrons from their parent atoms. The reason this is dangerous to humans (and other living things) is that it has the power to disrupt DNA molecules leading to cancer, mutation, or cell death. Cell phones utilize radio and microwaves to transmit their data, both of which fall well outside the range of ionizing radiation. In fact Radio and Micro waves are both less energetic than visual light. Your received dose, as others mentioned, is zero.\n\nIn comparison, you're constantly receiving tiny doses of ionizing radiation every day that are unavoidable. For starters, the Earth is constantly being irradiated by pretty much everything else in space, the sun, the stars, supernovas, and even black hole accretion disks. The Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere blocks out most of the more dangerous stuff, but secondary radiation does constantly reach the ground, so you're being constantly showered by gentle spray of alpha and beta particles. Another big\\* source in the modern day is Radon, which is particularly hefty at higher latitudes since houses are well sealed. Foods such as shellfish and reindeer meat are also notable for their tendency to concentrate radioactive isotopes. Even coal smoke can up your dose of radiation since it allows otherwise harmless radioisotopes to become airborne.\n\nNow, while all this radiation may sound scary, it's important to remember that all of these sources are miniscule compared to the doses required to produce a demonstrable increase in cancer rates, let alone cause radiation sickness.\n\nFinally, I can never pass up a good opportunity to [link this bad boy](https://xkcd.com/LINK). It really should be required reading for everybody who has any questions or concerns about radiation.",

        "description1": "An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/LINK\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

That doesn't seem correct. So then what is the true nature of time as it exists without someone to experience it?",
        "comment2": "We can say that there is a form of time that doesn't consider whether or not we have a conscious observer, which is the natural coordinate for \"distance\" along a line of freefall, which is called proper time ie. you've been falling for 4 seconds etc.\n\nYou can then use these lines of freefall (or timelike geodesics) and the lines perpendicular to them to make local coordinate systems that have time with reference to that time.\n\nSo general relativity can't tell you what is \"a long time\", it can't reproduce the subjective character of time, but you can say how many seconds actually passed for you.",

        "description1": "We are a bunch of cosmologists from the Cosmology from Home 2020 conference. Ask us anything, from our daily research to the organization of a large conference during COVID19! We have some special experts on\n\n+ Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today\n+ The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like, 13.4 billion years ago\n+ Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a \"cosmic web\" with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe\n+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be \"Dark Matter\", i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity\n+ Gravitational Lensing: Matter in the universe bends the path of light. This allows us to \"see\" the (invisible) dark matter in the Universe and how it is distributed\n+ *And ask anything else you want to know!*\n\nAnswering your questions tonight are\n\n+ Alexandre Adler: u/bachpropagate I\u2019m a PhD student in cosmology at Stockholm University. I mainly work on modeling sources of systematic errors for cosmic microwave background polarization experiments. You can find me on twitter @BachPropagate.\n+ Alex Gough: u/acwgough PhD student: Analytic techniques for studying clustering into the nonlinear regime, and on how to develop clever statistics to extract cosmological information. Previous work on modelling galactic foregrounds for CMB physics. Twitter: @acwgough.\n+ Arthur Tsang: u/onymous_ocelot Strong gravitational lensing and how we can use perturbations in lensed images to learn more about dark matter at smaller scales.\n+ Benjamin Wallisch: Cosmological probes of particle physics, neutrinos, early universe, cosmological probes of inflation, cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure of the universe.\n+ Giulia Giannini: u/astrowberries PhD student at IFAE in Spain. Studies weak lensing of distant galaxies as cosmological probes of dark energy.\n+ Hayley Macpherson: u/cosmohay. Numerical (and general) relativity, and cosmological simulations of large-scale structure formation\n+ Katie Mack: u/astro_katie. cosmology, dark matter, early universe, black holes, galaxy formation, end of universe\n+ Robert Lilow: (theoretical models for the) gravitational clustering of cosmic matter. (reconstruction of the) matter distribution in the local Universe.\n+ Robert Reischke: /u/rfreischke Large-scale structure, weak gravitational lensing, intensity mapping and statistics\n+ Shaun Hotchkiss: u/just_shaun large scale structure, fuzzy dark matter, compact object in the early universe, inflation. Twitter: @just_shaun\n+ Stefan Heimersheim: u/Stefan-Cosmo, 21cm cosmology, Cosmic Microwave Background, Dark Matter. Twitter: @AskScience_IoA\n+ Tilman Tr\u00f6ster u/space_statistics: weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure, statistics\n+ Valentina Cesare u/vale_astro: PhD working on modified theories of gravity on galaxy scale\n\nWe'll start answering questions from **19:00 GMT/UTC** on Friday (12pm PT, 3pm ET, 8pm BST, 9pm CEST) as well as live streaming our discussion of our answers via\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/LINK).

Hate to use theory again but the idea is that while their was a molten mantle and core,  the crust didn't float and drift .

        "description2": "So for instance color exist only in the mind, and in reality there are only photons with certain frequencies that our brain just interprets as red, blue, etc. And many of us know that when experiencing some intense or tramatic event time seems to slow down, so our perception seems to play some role in what time means to us, but how big is that role?\n\nIf color doesn't exist without a conscious observer, can time exist without a conscious observer? That doesn't seem correct. So then what is the true nature of time as it exists without someone to experience it?",
        "comment2": "We can say that there is a form of time that doesn't consider whether or not we have a conscious observer, which is the natural coordinate for \"distance\" along a line of freefall, which is called proper time ie. you've been falling for 4 seconds etc.\n\nYou can then use these lines of freefall (or timelike geodesics) and the lines perpendicular to them to make local coordinate systems that have time with reference to that time.\n\nSo general relativity can't tell you what is \"a long time\", it can't reproduce the subjective character of time, but you can say how many seconds actually passed for you.",
