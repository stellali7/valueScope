        "description1": "**TLDR: Is it less important to have lots of common interests with a romantic partner if you have close friends to engage in those interests with?**\n\nI'm dating these days and have been thinking about what I value in a potential SO. Someone I've been dating recently has almost complete overlap with my interests: climbing, camping, metal, reading novels and psychology, same tastes in movies and TV, Magic and D&amp;D, we do it all. It's really easy to imagine that we could just...never run out of things to do together.\n\nThis seems really valuable to me, but it's also different from other relationships I've had. My last relationship was with someone who thought games were useless, metal was frightening, camping was pointless discomfort, and reading was fine as long as it was self-improvement. But we could still talk endlessly, had a strong emotional connection, and the sex was fantastic. All along I felt like we *should* have more common interests, but if I'm being honest the relationship was still great without them.\n\nThis has got me thinking: how valuable is it really to be able to share so many interests with a romantic partner, and why do I feel like it's so important? In particular, I wonder if the value I place on this overlap in interests is because I don't have too many close friends to do those things with. Maybe if I were regularly doing all my interests with friends, it wouldn't feel so important to find an SO I can do those things with. The context here is that it has been way easier to find women who want to date me than men who want to befriend me, so I'm wondering whether that is throwing off my sense of what's important in a romantic partner.\n\nHow important do you think it is to have lots of overlapping common interests with an SO, even if you have lots of friends to engage in those interests with? For those of you in LTRs, what role have common interests played in your relationship?",

With people I considered myself really close with, they always liked him when they first met him, we had a great time at my mini-wedding ceremony.\n\nThen, when I recently went to my friend\u2019s house. They misinterpreted something my husband said to me on the phone (yes she was eavesdropping) and she was joking and telling me she was throwing me a divorce party. Mind you, they wanted me to come over so they could  surprise me with a bachelorette party (that I never had because the mini-wedding was rushed). They bought balloons and cookies and everything for me. It was really sweet, but the pleasant surprise lasted literally two minutes before she made the joke. And then proceeded to say horrible things about him for the remainder of the night. There was so much more said that night and i literally felt awful.\n\nShe was painting him out to be this evil dude (he most definitely is not and I am not in any danger I swear) not remembering apparently that he is literally my husband. Have had no complaints about him from any other friends these last (almost) 3 years. Not even from them until now. It actually made me really sad and ruined what was supposed to be a \u201cbachelorette\u201d party. I love my husband dearly and my friends too. But this honestly makes me want to keep them at arms length. So unless your friend is in danger, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It really hurts knowing your friends think ill of your partner. I\u2019m legit wondering if I should invite them to my \u201cbigger\u201d wedding ceremony",

        "comment2": "I was curious to see what people\u2019s responses in here were because this just happened to me recently. With people I considered myself really close with, they always liked him when they first met him, we had a great time at my mini-wedding ceremony.\n\nThen, when I recently went to my friend\u2019s house. They misinterpreted something my husband said to me on the phone (yes she was eavesdropping) and she was joking and telling me she was throwing me a divorce party. Mind you, they wanted me to come over so they could  surprise me with a bachelorette party (that I never had because the mini-wedding was rushed). They bought balloons and cookies and everything for me. It was really sweet, but the pleasant surprise lasted literally two minutes before she made the joke. And then proceeded to say horrible things about him for the remainder of the night. There was so much more said that night and i literally felt awful.\n\nShe was painting him out to be this evil dude (he most definitely is not and I am not in any danger I swear) not remembering apparently that he is literally my husband. Have had no complaints about him from any other friends these last (almost) 3 years. Not even from them until now. It actually made me really sad and ruined what was supposed to be a \u201cbachelorette\u201d party. I love my husband dearly and my friends too. But this honestly makes me want to keep them at arms length. So unless your friend is in danger, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It really hurts knowing your friends think ill of your partner. I\u2019m legit wondering if I should invite them to my \u201cbigger\u201d wedding ceremony",

Someone I've been dating recently has almost complete overlap with my interests: climbing, camping, metal, reading novels and psychology, same tastes in movies and TV, Magic and D&amp;D, we do it all. It's really easy to imagine that we could just...never run out of things to do together.\n\nThis seems really valuable to me, but it's also different from other relationships I've had. My last relationship was with someone who thought games were useless, metal was frightening, camping was pointless discomfort, and reading was fine as long as it was self-improvement. But we could still talk endlessly, had a strong emotional connection, and the sex was fantastic. All along I felt like we *should* have more common interests, but if I'm being honest the relationship was still great without them.\n\nThis has got me thinking: how valuable is it really to be able to share so many interests with a romantic partner, and why do I feel like it's so important? In particular, I wonder if the value I place on this overlap in interests is because I don't have too many close friends to do those things with. Maybe if I were regularly doing all my interests with friends, it wouldn't feel so important to find an SO I can do those things with. The context here is that it has been way easier to find women who want to date me than men who want to befriend me, so I'm wondering whether that is throwing off my sense of what's important in a romantic partner.\n\nHow important do you think it is to have lots of overlapping common interests with an SO, even if you have lots of friends to engage in those interests with?

With people I considered myself really close with, they always liked him when they first met him, we had a great time at my mini-wedding ceremony.\n\nThen, when I recently went to my friend\u2019s house. They misinterpreted something my husband said to me on the phone (yes she was eavesdropping) and she was joking and telling me she was throwing me a divorce party. Mind you, they wanted me to come over so they could  surprise me with a bachelorette party (that I never had because the mini-wedding was rushed). They bought balloons and cookies and everything for me. It was really sweet, but the pleasant surprise lasted literally two minutes before she made the joke. And then proceeded to say horrible things about him for the remainder of the night. There was so much more said that night and i literally felt awful.\n\nShe was painting him out to be this evil dude (he most definitely is not and I am not in any danger I swear) not remembering apparently that he is literally my husband. Have had no complaints about him from any other friends these last (almost) 3 years. Not even from them until now. It actually made me really sad and ruined what was supposed to be a \u201cbachelorette\u201d party. I love my husband dearly and my friends too. But this honestly makes me want to keep them at arms length. So unless your friend is in danger, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It really hurts knowing your friends think ill of your partner.

Someone I've been dating recently has almost complete overlap with my interests: climbing, camping, metal, reading novels and psychology, same tastes in movies and TV, Magic and D&amp;D, we do it all. It's really easy to imagine that we could just...never run out of things to do together.\n\nThis seems really valuable to me, but it's also different from other relationships I've had. My last relationship was with someone who thought games were useless, metal was frightening, camping was pointless discomfort, and reading was fine as long as it was self-improvement. But we could still talk endlessly, had a strong emotional connection, and the sex was fantastic. All along I felt like we *should* have more common interests, but if I'm being honest the relationship was still great without them.\n\nThis has got me thinking: how valuable is it really to be able to share so many interests with a romantic partner, and why do I feel like it's so important? In particular, I wonder if the value I place on this overlap in interests is because I don't have too many close friends to do those things with. Maybe if I were regularly doing all my interests with friends, it wouldn't feel so important to find an SO I can do those things with. The context here is that it has been way easier to find women who want to date me than men who want to befriend me, so I'm wondering whether that is throwing off my sense of what's important in a romantic partner.\n\nHow important do you think it is to have lots of overlapping common interests with an SO, even if you have lots of friends to engage in those interests with? For those of you in LTRs, what role have common interests played in your relationship?",

With people I considered myself really close with, they always liked him when they first met him, we had a great time at my mini-wedding ceremony.\n\nThen, when I recently went to my friend\u2019s house. They misinterpreted something my husband said to me on the phone (yes she was eavesdropping) and she was joking and telling me she was throwing me a divorce party. Mind you, they wanted me to come over so they could  surprise me with a bachelorette party (that I never had because the mini-wedding was rushed). They bought balloons and cookies and everything for me. It was really sweet, but the pleasant surprise lasted literally two minutes before she made the joke. And then proceeded to say horrible things about him for the remainder of the night. There was so much more said that night and i literally felt awful.\n\nShe was painting him out to be this evil dude (he most definitely is not and I am not in any danger I swear) not remembering apparently that he is literally my husband. Have had no complaints about him from any other friends these last (almost) 3 years. Not even from them until now. It actually made me really sad and ruined what was supposed to be a \u201cbachelorette\u201d party. I love my husband dearly and my friends too. But this honestly makes me want to keep them at arms length. So unless your friend is in danger, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It really hurts knowing your friends think ill of your partner.

        "comment2": "&gt;idk what to do \n\nYou could try to do a few things that could help with self acceptance, you could look for support and talk with a few others, you could have a few explaining materials ready, etc.\n\nTrans people often learned to suppress how they really feel concerning gender because they made experiences it would not be accepted.\n\nMany also picked up that it would be shameful somehow.\n\nThere are more and more studies showing its a biological condition, due to a mismatch of transmitter substances before birth. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8vo33r/my_master_list_of_trans_health_citations_in/LINK) and in the whole thread a number of studies are cited.\n\nIt is legit how people really feel and it may help with self acceptance. And over time, it is possible to adapt the outside to how people really feel.\n\nSo basically it is possible to reconnect to a feeling of genuine happyness concerning gender step by step.\n\nMany  also learned to develop a mental analyizing process bringing up fears and doubts. \n\nThis can keep people spinning in circles.\n\nAs said it is possible to reconnect to what would make a person genuinely happy concerning gender step by step, and to listen less to thoughs of what if.\n\nYou could try to concentrate on things you like and that are within reach. Don't concentrate too much on things you don't like, or on things you feel you can't have.\n\nIts like a gardener. Don't water the weeds. Water the plants you want to have, and do things that make them grow.\n\nAnd it may be possible to regularly do a few small things you like for motivation. Here :  \n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=xFAHekwBiS0 \n\nmight be a number of things that could be used, regardless of how far along people are.\n\nAnd for the moment taking deep and slow breaths and trying to concentrate on the surrounding could help.\n\nAnd a number of things from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/924xd8/help_am_i_trans/LINK)  post might help you too. There are hints there concerning presentation, starting with neutral styles first, etc.\n\nAnd there are also hints there concerning looking for a gender therapist in case.\n\nAtm many therapists may use skype. And there are also online therapists. Some have sliding scales depending on income, and if it is connected with depressions it might be covered.\n\nAnd some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true ), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.\n\nAnd it may be an idea to write down a few answers to the vid with questions, and read it to them, or give it to them. It may be easier than talking.\n\nIts up to you when and how to come out ... a number of people wait a while until there are some results, and only come out to select people first..\n\nIn any case doing things well prepared, looking for support and having a few explaining resources ready may be a good idea.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/e66v70/how_do_i_ask_someone_to_use_my_pronouns/LINK) might be a number of explaining resources and there are also hints there concerning looking for support. \n\nAnd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/gxc1yu/alert_we_are_under_pressure_from_organized_groups/LINK) is a summary as pdf that can also be sent to others.\n\nThe sub TransAdoption might additionally be a place of support and they also have a discord. And on the subs egg_irl and TransGamers there are discords and it may be possible to meet a few like minded people there. Talking with a few others about what they did might be helpful too.\n\nI'd say keep going.\n\n\n*hugs*",

I definitely got mixed reactions when I started coming out to people, and while some of my closer friends stayed with me, I was slowly kinda shunned out of the Church. Luckily, I wasn't too deep in, and now I'm living a much different and better life now.\n\nIt took awhile for myself to accept that I'm trans because it's this huge daunting thing, but I slowly started to realize that the depression and insecurity I felt starting right around puberty was all centered around gender dysphoria and being trans. Four years after I admitted to myself that I am trans, I knew that I had to transition for my own sanity, and I'm so glad I did. \n\nI relate a lot to what you've said, and I was in a similar spot five years ago. I'm not sure what advice I'd give to you, but something I wish I had known is that I am trans, that's okay, and transitioning will give me so much joy despite the negative things that come along with it. \n\nPlease feel free to DM me or reply if you want someone to talk to about this stuff. Idk about you, but five years ago, I was the only trans person I knew. Good luck!\n\nEllie",

I definitely got mixed reactions when I started coming out to people, and while some of my closer friends stayed with me, I was slowly kinda shunned out of the Church. Luckily, I wasn't too deep in, and now I'm living a much different and better life now.\n\nIt took awhile for myself to accept that I'm trans because it's this huge daunting thing, but I slowly started to realize that the depression and insecurity I felt starting right around puberty was all centered around gender dysphoria and being trans. Four years after I admitted to myself that I am trans, I knew that I had to transition for my own sanity, and I'm so glad I did. \n\nI relate a lot to what you've said, and I was in a similar spot five years ago. I'm not sure what advice I'd give to you, but something I wish I had known is that I am trans, that's okay, and transitioning will give me so much joy despite the negative things that come along with it. \n\nPlease feel free to DM me or reply if you want someone to talk to about this stuff. Idk about you, but five years ago, I was the only trans person I knew. Good luck!\n\nEllie",

With people I considered myself really close with, they always liked him when they first met him, we had a great time at my mini-wedding ceremony.\n\nThen, when I recently went to my friend\u2019s house. They misinterpreted something my husband said to me on the phone (yes she was eavesdropping) and she was joking and telling me she was throwing me a divorce party. Mind you, they wanted me to come over so they could  surprise me with a bachelorette party (that I never had because the mini-wedding was rushed). They bought balloons and cookies and everything for me. It was really sweet, but the pleasant surprise lasted literally two minutes before she made the joke. And then proceeded to say horrible things about him for the remainder of the night. There was so much more said that night and i literally felt awful.\n\nShe was painting him out to be this evil dude (he most definitely is not and I am not in any danger I swear) not remembering apparently that he is literally my husband. Have had no complaints about him from any other friends these last (almost) 3 years. Not even from them until now. It actually made me really sad and ruined what was supposed to be a \u201cbachelorette\u201d party. I love my husband dearly and my friends too. But this honestly makes me want to keep them at arms length. So unless your friend is in danger, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It really hurts knowing your friends think ill of your partner.

Since then things have gotten icy and weird and I'm feeling a bit bullied. Yesterday the house leader requested I send my ID to them all because \"we don't even know your real name\". My ID does not yet reflect my name and gender and I'm going into a tailspin over this, and it feels mean \n\nAm I rational in feeling attacked and, do I have any legal standing not to show them my ID?

        "comment2": "Laws vary somewhat state to state and you didn't specify where you live, so there's no telling what your legal situation is. You would do well to Google the relevant laws and learn your rights. Not being on the lease is bad, but it might not be so bad that HL can just kick you out with no notice. If you find a relevant law or precedent, screenshot it and have it ready. \n\nShort term, you can simply ignore the request for ID. HL has no authority to demand it, and can only threaten to have you evicted if you don't placate her. It's a good reason to make your name change legal as soon as you have the means to do so. If you don't want to show your ID, you can explain that to your roommates - particularly to the others who have not been so confrontational toward you. It's not your real name. It's your legal name, temporarily, and when the change is complete your new legal name will be the name you've given them. Maybe this issue is not an ultimatum.",

I was already to start my initiating appointment and all I needed was to check in with my old liver specialist (I had liver cancer as a kid).\n\nAnd now I'm broken. He explained that, while it's limited info to go on, I have a rare condition (focal nodular hyperplasia) that brings risks with exposure to exogenous estrogens. Basically, introducing outside estrogen may cause my benign tumors to become malignant and that's an aggressive form of cancer. He doesn't know of any trans women who had this condition, but he once treated a cis woman with the same condition as me; she went on exogenous estrogen when she took HRT so she could get pregnant, her tumors grew and she died.\n\nI'm telling the whole story not because I want anyone to try and explain it back to me or figure out a hack. I'm going to talk to an endocrinologist about that.\n\nBut now I'm facing the real chance that I may not be able to safely go feminizing hormones. For the longest time I've coped with dysphoria by telling myself it'll get easier when I get HRT. I don't know how to face this reality where I can't do HRT.\n\nPlease help. I've hedged all my bets on this and can't think of what to do if I can't get this procedure. I'm worried in the long run it'll make my life impossible to live.\n\nEDIT: Some people have suggested patches/gels/injections. I brought this up and while he admits he isn't familiar with transgender hormone therapy, he made it clear that even if the liver doesn't process these directly, it does come back to it. Indicated the problem may flat out be I can't introduce exogenous hormones at all.\n\n2nd EDIT: A lot of people have talked with me about finding a work around for how to get HRT. I really appreciate that, but what I'm really trying to cope with now is the idea of a future where I can only socially, but not medically, transition. I was wondering if anyone had perspective on that.\n\n3rd EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone who commented and I wish I could hug you all if you were okay with that! I can't say I've made any huge bounds, but seeing all of you come together and try to do what you can to help me reminds me that the actual best part of being trans is how so many of us learn community care. I am planning on doing a follow-up with my liver specialist, but instead of trying to talk to him one-on-one and be my own advocate, I will search for an endocrinologist who specializes in feminizing hormone therapy. That way, I'm not alone in understanding what his liver knowledge means for my endocrine system. I am still deeply pessimistic, but I'm not going to totally turn away from this option until I've truly exhausted it.",

        "comment2": "&gt;idk what to do \n\nYou could try to do a few things that could help with self acceptance, you could look for support and talk with a few others, you could have a few explaining materials ready, etc.\n\nTrans people often learned to suppress how they really feel concerning gender because they made experiences it would not be accepted.\n\nMany also picked up that it would be shameful somehow.\n\nThere are more and more studies showing its a biological condition, due to a mismatch of transmitter substances before birth. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8vo33r/my_master_list_of_trans_health_citations_in/LINK) and in the whole thread a number of studies are cited.\n\nIt is legit how people really feel and it may help with self acceptance. And over time, it is possible to adapt the outside to how people really feel.\n\nSo basically it is possible to reconnect to a feeling of genuine happyness concerning gender step by step.\n\nMany  also learned to develop a mental analyizing process bringing up fears and doubts. \n\nThis can keep people spinning in circles.\n\nAs said it is possible to reconnect to what would make a person genuinely happy concerning gender step by step, and to listen less to thoughs of what if.\n\nYou could try to concentrate on things you like and that are within reach. Don't concentrate too much on things you don't like, or on things you feel you can't have.\n\nIts like a gardener. Don't water the weeds. Water the plants you want to have, and do things that make them grow.\n\nAnd it may be possible to regularly do a few small things you like for motivation. Here :  \n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=xFAHekwBiS0 \n\nmight be a number of things that could be used, regardless of how far along people are.\n\nAnd for the moment taking deep and slow breaths and trying to concentrate on the surrounding could help.\n\nAnd a number of things from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/924xd8/help_am_i_trans/LINK)  post might help you too. There are hints there concerning presentation, starting with neutral styles first, etc.\n\nAnd there are also hints there concerning looking for a gender therapist in case.\n\nAtm many therapists may use skype. And there are also online therapists. Some have sliding scales depending on income, and if it is connected with depressions it might be covered.\n\nAnd some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true ), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.\n\nAnd it may be an idea to write down a few answers to the vid with questions, and read it to them, or give it to them. It may be easier than talking.\n\nIts up to you when and how to come out ... a number of people wait a while until there are some results, and only come out to select people first..\n\nIn any case doing things well prepared, looking for support and having a few explaining resources ready may be a good idea.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/e66v70/how_do_i_ask_someone_to_use_my_pronouns/LINK) might be a number of explaining resources and there are also hints there concerning looking for support. \n\nAnd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/gxc1yu/alert_we_are_under_pressure_from_organized_groups/LINK) is a summary as pdf that can also be sent to others.\n\nThe sub TransAdoption might additionally be a place of support and they also have a discord. And on the subs egg_irl and TransGamers there are discords and it may be possible to meet a few like minded people there. Talking with a few others about what they did might be helpful too.\n\nI'd say keep going.\n\n\n*hugs*",

        "description1": "Hi. \n\nI've identified myself as a cis male as long as I can remember. I've never questioned it until about a year ago. For several years now I've felt like my masculinity has been stripped away, slowly but surely. All of this has made all my feminine qualities - both physical and mental - stand out to me. \n\nI've never felt like the typical male. I never felt like I belonged with the other guys because I was so different from them. This sense of not belonging to my gender group has only grown stronger as time went by.\n\nI started playing computer games with female protagonists simply because it made more sense to me. I've also played a lot of visual novels about feminization, where the male protagonist embraces this process and in the end identifies as female.\n\nI keep picturing what it's like having a female body. It's on my mind all the time. I used the FaceApp gender filter and almost became obsessed with the resulting photo of a woman who looked a lot like me, only better. I've even given her a name.\n\nI've looked at myself in the mirror wearing a skirt, and every time thought to myself I looked more attractive. In fact, I saw a woman, given my female curvy body shape and lack of body hair. I can't stop thinking about that, so I repeating the experience.\n\nI've also started observing the women around me, noting the way they dress, the way they move, talk and the make-up they wear. The attraction I feel isn't about wanting to be with any of them as a couple, it's more about wanting to be more like them. \n\nI don't know what all this means. I feel confused and messed up most of the time. I've been a part of a very close-knit faith community since I was a kid. I'm married to the pastor's daughter. We all know how most christians view (and judge) trans people, so going down that road really scares me. Still, I think I owe it to myself to try and sort this all out.\n\nI would so appreciate hearing your thoughts about my situation, and any advice you might offer. I feel like talking to someone who's been through this. I guess I feel in need of some support.",
        "comment1": "I was in leadership at my church when I had this same realization. I lived in denial for a few years, but I eventually knew what I had to do. I definitely got mixed reactions when I started coming out to people, and while some of my closer friends stayed with me, I was slowly kinda shunned out of the Church. Luckily, I wasn't too deep in, and now I'm living a much different and better life now.\n\nIt took awhile for myself to accept that I'm trans because it's this huge daunting thing, but I slowly started to realize that the depression and insecurity I felt starting right around puberty was all centered around gender dysphoria and being trans. Four years after I admitted to myself that I am trans, I knew that I had to transition for my own sanity, and I'm so glad I did. \n\nI relate a lot to what you've said, and I was in a similar spot five years ago. I'm not sure what advice I'd give to you, but something I wish I had known is that I am trans, that's okay, and transitioning will give me so much joy despite the negative things that come along with it. \n\nPlease feel free to DM me or reply if you want someone to talk to about this stuff. Idk about you, but five years ago, I was the only trans person I knew. Good luck!\n\nEllie",

Like feeling uncomfortable in womans bathrooms but not mens, though this could just be due to imposter syndrome. As a big fear of mine is using transness to invade women\u2019s spaces, being the person terfs are afraid of.

A lot of women's spaces *try* to be inclusive, but they don't know what non-binary entails (they just want fake inclusivity bragging rights and sometimes only want afab enbies because they view them as \"diet female\"). I suggest women's spaces that are LGBTQ+ friendly as well (there's really no way to be sure until you try).\n\nAlso, something that helped me make the decision to transition was the revelation that *most* trans people aren't 1000% sure until they (and sometimes even during) transition. I still get imposter syndrome despite being out to family, friends, and work, taking hormones, and starting the process of changing my name and gender marker. It's almost like, going for what will make you happiest is scary because you've never felt that happiness and peace before (at least for me).\n\nAnyway, good luck love!

If you don't want to show your ID, you can explain that to your roommates - particularly to the others who have not been so confrontational toward you. It's not your real name.

I\u2019m thinking of starting my treatment with them till I found something a little closer. \n\nThanks in advance ^^",

Anyway he said that, try to think of what it feels like just being alone as man or woman. And honestly I find this hard, but i think being a woman at home feels nice, bubbly, fun, exciting. But as a man, well for alot of my life I\u2019ve felt a disconnect, like looking at the world through a pane of glass. There but not fully. \n\nSo saying this it seems clear thay I\u2019m trans (probably trans fem ebny. Yet, there are things that cause doubt for me. Like feeling uncomfortable in womans bathrooms but not mens, though this could just be due to imposter syndrome. As a big fear of mine is using transness to invade women\u2019s spaces, being the person terfs are afraid of.  I just hate my constant doubts, every-time Ithink I know who i am I get my doubts again",
        "comment1": "I think. You know who you truly are and, despite having doubts, it definitely means something that you keep coming back to the same conclusion.\n\nIt's okay to have doubts. I'm a transmasc enby and I feel uncomfortable using the woman's restroom (despite being afab) but the men's restroom feels very alien to me (I'll work up the courage one of these days, lol).\n\nDon't let what other people think give you imposter syndrome. A lot of women's spaces *try* to be inclusive, but they don't know what non-binary entails (they just want fake inclusivity bragging rights and sometimes only want afab enbies because they view them as \"diet female\"). I suggest women's spaces that are LGBTQ+ friendly as well (there's really no way to be sure until you try).\n\nAlso, something that helped me make the decision to transition was the revelation that *most* trans people aren't 1000% sure until they (and sometimes even during) transition. I still get imposter syndrome despite being out to family, friends, and work, taking hormones, and starting the process of changing my name and gender marker. It's almost like, going for what will make you happiest is scary because you've never felt that happiness and peace before (at least for me).\n\nAnyway, good luck love!
