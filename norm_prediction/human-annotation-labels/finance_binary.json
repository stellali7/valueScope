        "title1": "Silver ETFs A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity",
        "description1": "As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy the PSLV ETF or call options on the SLV ETF** **for 36 USD on 1/21**.\n\nSilver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver\u2019s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.\n\nSilver\u2019s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.\n\nHistorically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been \u201cconsumed\u201d and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.\n\nStepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.\n\nWhile the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn\u2019t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.\n\nThis last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.\n\nSo today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.\n\nNow why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven\u2019t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.\n\nThe way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.\n\nYou see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.\n\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.\n\nSo do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.\n\nIf you look at both instances of silver\u2019s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November. If you are interested in learning more about the large silver price manipulation on the COMEX futures market take a look at the documentation online by Ted Butler, Ed Steer, and Bert Chilton.

        "description1": "First Wave BioPharma (FWBI) just did a reverse split. Free float is now under one million shares and the price target is $270 if you take the reverse split into account. The price target is set by Roth Capital on May 26, 2022. Check the price target on Webull.\n\nWhat's crazy is AzurRx Bio bought First Wave Bio last year (Sept) for $229 million and today they have a combined market cap of under $5 million so the target price of $270 isn't that weird.\n\nBut it's unimportant because I would never invest in Bio long-term because of the risks.\n\nI think I see a fairly good short-term investment due to the fact that the stock is heavily shorted and if the price starts to rise upwards, so I see a fairly large opportunity for squeeze as the short ones made a good profit already and can cover their positions. Or even need do it to make as big a profit as possible.\n\nShould the price go up without them having covered their positions, it will not be as big of a profit for them. Of course, unless they see an opportunity for even bigger profits because they think the price may go down further.\n\nIt's obviously just speculation based on the fact that I've seen RHE, NVIV, QNRX and a few more where something similar happened.\n\nReverse stock split. 1 for 30 \n\nAs for the number of shares before and after split, many people are wrong. It's not about how many shares you have, but how many percent of the company you/you own, and that's as much after as it was before the split. No difference. \n\nThis panic that people get in connection with the reverse split only happens in the USA and not in a single other country in the world. Whether it's about ignorance or something else, I don't know. But at least I know that this is exploited by shorts. The news about the revrese split always causes the price (in the US) to plummet, so then shorts are in a very good position.",

Unless you plan to margin your position at a lower price, you're much safer simply recovering your losses over time by bag holding. If you're confident in the stock enough to rebuy, then you should be confident enough to baghold while it comes back up.

        "description1": "Good morning! \n\nI'm by no means anything closer to an expert in the market, I just invest my money in few big corps like AAPL, MA, MSFT, AMD, COST that I believe will continue to excel, and have been and plan on holding for years. My point being... that I'm not the one to give advises. But today morning was one of those times where I woke up around 5 AM, was fully awake and knew I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. After scrolling through this sub for a few minutes, I suddenly had an urge to review my entire career in investing.\n\nNow, I have a feeling that many of you who are much more practical than me have already been doing this. But for those like me who haven't done this yet, I strongly recommend trying this activity!\n\nFrom the summer of 2016, where I made the first trade of my life (bought FB at 107), I recorded every single trade including dates, purchase/sell prices, and left specific comments about what I've learnt from investing in that company. It wasn't fun to begin with - going through all the statements and manually inputting them into excel; but it was fun at the end and I got a lot out of it. \n\nYou get to see how you evolve as an investor (and as a person). Back in 2016 I was happy with returns of couple hundred bucks from companies like MSFT and AMZN lol (imagine if I held strong until today). Later on I got to see few companies that I tried swing trading, where I obviously lost money, then I could see that I stopped doing swing/day trading at all. It was good to see that I learn from my mistakes! You also get to test your ability to forecast company's futures. I got to see a couple growth companies that I bet on actually thrive: like SQ, AMD (any of you remember how pessimistic the views were when AMD fell all the way down to $16 from being overvalued at $30?), and I also saw few other growth companies that I was wrong with. It gets very insightful to remember why I was so hopeful of a company, and to actually find out why the company failed years after.\n\nThere are so many other little things that you see and learn from, but I think this post will get too long to write them all. At the end of the day, I strongly recommend giving this a try because not only did I learn a lot from it, but it was also fun looking back at younger myself, which a lot of us forget to do while living a busy day-to-day life.\n\nHappy new years to you all, and happy investing in 2022!",

        "description1": "If this is true, then Apple is about to make a crap-ton of money. Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/LINK) where I found this stat:\n\n* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.\n\n* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.\n\n* GM, which wasn\u2019t listed on Apple\u2019s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. \n\n* Tesla, which doesn\u2019t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its \u201cFSD\u201d driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.\n\n* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple\u2019s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.\n\n* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car\u2019s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.\n\nThis sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:\n\n* iPhone obviously.\n* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.\n* Apple home IOT networks.\n* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.\n\nWhile this is all exciting, that 79% sounds very inflated. For those of you looking to buy new cars, is having CarPlay really that big of a criteria when you consider your next vehicle?\n\n*Disclosure I own a lot of Apple.*",

        "description1": "Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.\n\nAs a result of the four Macs with \u200cM1\u200c and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.\n\nHowever, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\n\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/LINK",

        "title2": "Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips",
        "description2": "This is long, if you\u2019re uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if \"they\" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders\u2014ABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it\u2019s hedging against itself as it\u2019s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/LINK)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52\u2013that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge\u2014we\u2019re onto something.*\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven\u2019t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend\u2014this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/LINK)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That\u2019s a flag for us\u2014sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/LINK](https://i.imgur.com/LINK)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 1: Don\u2019t get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/LINK)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM\u2019s some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you\u2019re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. \n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**\n\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n\n**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n\n**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won\u2019t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. \n\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. \n\n**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren\u2019t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. \n\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.\n\n**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.\n\n**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.\n\n**Positions**:\nDumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including\n\nWKHSc\nPLTRc\nSPYc (1/19, 1/22)\nLMNDp\n\nAnd a couple tickers that I couldn\u2019t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps\n\n***\n\nTLDR\nUse a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.\n\n***\n\n*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I\u2019m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it\u2019s not a day I don\u2019t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there\u2019s no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful\u2014 not selling anything) I\u2019ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.  Later.*",

That's definitely one of the main goals of this community. We don't want to run people off, but at the same time we want there to at least be some sort of standard to what constitutes \"low effort.\" We wish to differentiate between legitimate, detailed questions predicated upon at least a base level of due dilligence and questions that may be better served going into an \"other folder,\" so to speak.\n\nAlso to note, anything that fits the description of what goes in this thread will be deleted from the \"main sub,\" so there may be a learning curve of people wondering why their posts are getting deleted. This new format sticky thread will be auto re-posted daily so as not to get too cluttered.\n\nThe following is a list of what is relegated to this \"catch all\" thread, and is subject to change based on the needs of the sub:\n\n1. What broker should I use?\n2. What do you guys think of \"XXXX\" stock?\n3. Should I buy or sell \"XXXX\" stock?\n4. Any threads with ZERO DD\n5. Anything that would have gone into the \"any stocks go here\" sticky thread (cryprocurrency is still banned)\n6. Any questions you think might be \"stupid\" questions\n7.

        "description1": "Quick summary: Evergrande is a real-estate developer from China that has $305 billion of liabilities and cannot pay of their debt. They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing. Right now, the Chinese government is doing what they can to control the situation (allowing them to default on loans, setting a price floor on property). [https://www.reuters.com/LINK](https://www.reuters.com/business/LINK)  \n\n\nGiven this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  \n\n\n(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  \n\n\n(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  \n\n\n(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.  \n\n\nAny other ideas they you can think of?",

        "description2": "First Wave BioPharma (FWBI) just did a reverse split. Free float is now under one million shares and the price target is $270 if you take the reverse split into account. The price target is set by Roth Capital on May 26, 2022. Check the price target on Webull.\n\nWhat's crazy is AzurRx Bio bought First Wave Bio last year (Sept) for $229 million and today they have a combined market cap of under $5 million so the target price of $270 isn't that weird.\n\nBut it's unimportant because I would never invest in Bio long-term because of the risks.\n\nI think I see a fairly good short-term investment due to the fact that the stock is heavily shorted and if the price starts to rise upwards, so I see a fairly large opportunity for squeeze as the short ones made a good profit already and can cover their positions. Or even need do it to make as big a profit as possible.\n\nShould the price go up without them having covered their positions, it will not be as big of a profit for them. Of course, unless they see an opportunity for even bigger profits because they think the price may go down further.\n\nIt's obviously just speculation based on the fact that I've seen RHE, NVIV, QNRX and a few more where something similar happened.\n\nReverse stock split. 1 for 30 \n\nAs for the number of shares before and after split, many people are wrong. It's not about how many shares you have, but how many percent of the company you/you own, and that's as much after as it was before the split. No difference. \n\nThis panic that people get in connection with the reverse split only happens in the USA and not in a single other country in the world. Whether it's about ignorance or something else, I don't know. But at least I know that this is exploited by shorts. The news about the revrese split always causes the price (in the US) to plummet, so then shorts are in a very good position.",

        "title1": "Silver ETFs A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity",
        "description1": "As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy the PSLV ETF or call options on the SLV ETF** **for 36 USD on 1/21**.\n\nSilver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver\u2019s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.\n\nSilver\u2019s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.\n\nHistorically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been \u201cconsumed\u201d and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.\n\nStepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.\n\nWhile the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn\u2019t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.\n\nThis last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.\n\nSo today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.\n\nNow why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven\u2019t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.\n\nThe way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.\n\nYou see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.\n\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.\n\nSo do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.\n\nIf you look at both instances of silver\u2019s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November. If you are interested in learning more about the large silver price manipulation on the COMEX futures market take a look at the documentation online by Ted Butler, Ed Steer, and Bert Chilton.

        "description1": "[https://www.irishtimes.com/LINK](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/LINK)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/LINK) shifted more than $75.4 billion (\u20ac63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial \u201cdouble-Irish\u201d tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.\n\nThe technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/LINK) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/LINK) at the time of the transfer.\n\nThe move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/LINK) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.\n\nA year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of \u20ac23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.\n\nGoogle has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.\n\nCompanies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed \u2013 unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.\n\nThe \u201cdouble Irish\u201d was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.\n\nGoogle overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.\n\nUp to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the \u201cstandard rate tax is 0 per cent\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: \u201cIn December 2019, in line with the OECD\u2019s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.\n\n\u201cIncluding all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,\u201d she added.\n\nThe accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.\n\nTurnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company\u2019s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.\n\nDividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&amp;D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.\n\nGoogle Ireland, the tech company\u2019s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded \u20ac45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to \u20ac1.94 billion. It paid \u20ac263 million in tax that year, down nearly \u20ac9 million versus 2018.\n\nIt is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/LINK) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",

        "description1": "If this is true, then Apple is about to make a crap-ton of money. Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/LINK) where I found this stat:\n\n* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.\n\n* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.\n\n* GM, which wasn\u2019t listed on Apple\u2019s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. \n\n* Tesla, which doesn\u2019t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its \u201cFSD\u201d driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.\n\n* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple\u2019s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.\n\n* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car\u2019s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.\n\nThis sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:\n\n* iPhone obviously.\n* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.\n* Apple home IOT networks.\n* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.\n\nWhile this is all exciting, that 79% sounds very inflated. For those of you looking to buy new cars, is having CarPlay really that big of a criteria when you consider your next vehicle?\n\n*Disclosure I own a lot of Apple.*",

My point being... that I'm not the one to give advises. But today morning was one of those times where I woke up around 5 AM, was fully awake and knew I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. After scrolling through this sub for a few minutes, I suddenly had an urge to review my entire career in investing.\n\nNow, I have a feeling that many of you who are much more practical than me have already been doing this. But for those like me who haven't done this yet, I strongly recommend trying this activity!\n\nFrom the summer of 2016, where I made the first trade of my life (bought FB at 107), I recorded every single trade including dates, purchase/sell prices, and left specific comments about what I've learnt from investing in that company. It wasn't fun to begin with - going through all the statements and manually inputting them into excel; but it was fun at the end and I got a lot out of it. \n\nYou get to see how you evolve as an investor (and as a person). Back in 2016 I was happy with returns of couple hundred bucks from companies like MSFT and AMZN lol (imagine if I held strong until today). Later on I got to see few companies that I tried swing trading, where I obviously lost money, then I could see that I stopped doing swing/day trading at all. It was good to see that I learn from my mistakes! You also get to test your ability to forecast company's futures. I got to see a couple growth companies that I bet on actually thrive: like SQ, AMD (any of you remember how pessimistic the views were when AMD fell all the way down to $16 from being overvalued at $30?), and I also saw few other growth companies that I was wrong with. It gets very insightful to remember why I was so hopeful of a company, and to actually find out why the company failed years after.\n\nThere are so many other little things that you see and learn from, but I think this post will get too long to write them all. At the end of the day, I strongly recommend giving this a try because not only did I learn a lot from it, but it was also fun looking back at younger myself, which a lot of us forget to do while living a busy day-to-day life.\n\nHappy new years to you all, and happy investing in 2022!",
