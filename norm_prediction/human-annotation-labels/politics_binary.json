Customize several Gulfstream business jets with military engines and with equipment to produce and disperse fine droplets of sulfuric acid. Fly the jets up around 20 kilometers\u2014significantly higher than the cruising altitude for a commercial jetliner but still well within their range. At that altitude in the tropics, the aircraft are in the lower stratosphere. The planes spray the sulfuric acid, carefully controlling the rate of its release. The sulfur combines with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols, fine particles less than a micrometer in diameter. These get swept upward by natural wind patterns and are dispersed over the globe, including the poles. Once spread across the stratosphere, the aerosols will reflect about 1 percent of the sunlight hitting Earth back into space. Increasing what scientists call the planet\u2019s albedo, or reflective power, will partially offset the warming effects caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.\"",

Customize several Gulfstream business jets with military engines and with equipment to produce and disperse fine droplets of sulfuric acid. Fly the jets up around 20 kilometers\u2014significantly higher than the cruising altitude for a commercial jetliner but still well within their range. At that altitude in the tropics, the aircraft are in the lower stratosphere. The planes spray the sulfuric acid, carefully controlling the rate of its release. The sulfur combines with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols, fine particles less than a micrometer in diameter. These get swept upward by natural wind patterns and are dispersed over the globe, including the poles. Once spread across the stratosphere, the aerosols will reflect about 1 percent of the sunlight hitting Earth back into space. Increasing what scientists call the planet\u2019s albedo, or reflective power, will partially offset the warming effects caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.\"",

        "comment2": "This is a nonsensical argument.  The debt isn't coming from those payments.  It's coming from all of the other nonsense that we are spending money on.  That money isn't debt.  It's our own money the government took from us!  It doesn't create debt to give us back our own money.  Hell, it's not even all the money I paid to the government.  I've paid considerably more than $2,000 this year.  So they still have a lot of my money.  The debt is being added by the other stuff they want to do with my money, the stuff that my money and every other taxpayer's money isn't enough to cover.  That's debt.  \n\nTo put it another way, if someone took a thousand dollars from you and then gave you back 500, no debt was created.  If they took the thousand dollars from you and dedicated it to you or someone else in the future at higher dollar amount, **that** is debt if the extra money isn't funded.  If it were properly invested and then paid back, no debt.  If it were not properly invested and instead squandered on other spending projects resulting in a requirement to print money to give you your return, well, **that** is debt.\n\nBut no, giving people back $2k of their own money is not creating one dime worth of debt.  The debt is coming from the fact that the government insists on printing more money to give billions to other crap like Sudan and Egypt and museums and more.  The government could just decide to not do any of those things and give us back our money.  Then they'd not be creating a dime worth of debt.  The debt is created by them taking our money, returning it, then printing more to fund their pet projects.  To argue that giving us back our own money creates debt is saying that **we are obligated to give Sudan over half a billion dollars to our own personal detriment!**  Our government shut us down economically and hurt our finances.  Now, when it sounds as though you might get back some of your own tax money, people say it's debt on our children.  I suppose that's because they think that even in your toughest, most painful moments when you're being hurt by the government that you **still** have an obligation to be using your money to fund gender programs in Pakistan.  \n\nHow about this?  How about no, we are not obligated to pay for women's projects in Pakistan.  We are not obligated to pay for Egypt's military.  We are not obligated to fund Sudan's terrorism restitution.  We are not obligated to give money to museums that are closed due to COVID.  And instead of doing all of that stuff, you just send us back our money.  There.  No debt.  No controversy.  \n\nOr better yet, since we shouldn't be doing any of that crap in the first place, how about the government just stop taking that money from us?\n\nOne thing this bill did that is extremely productive and revealing is this... it told us all just how much in taxes the government does **not** need to be taking from us.  All of that shit in that bill is useless to us and should not be funded, so that amount of money should never leave our pockets and go to the government in the first place.  How about government just take what it needs to perform its essential functions instead of taking excess to make corrupt friendships around the world?",

Customize several Gulfstream business jets with military engines and with equipment to produce and disperse fine droplets of sulfuric acid. Fly the jets up around 20 kilometers\u2014significantly higher than the cruising altitude for a commercial jetliner but still well within their range. At that altitude in the tropics, the aircraft are in the lower stratosphere. The planes spray the sulfuric acid, carefully controlling the rate of its release. The sulfur combines with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols, fine particles less than a micrometer in diameter. These get swept upward by natural wind patterns and are dispersed over the globe, including the poles. Once spread across the stratosphere, the aerosols will reflect about 1 percent of the sunlight hitting Earth back into space. Increasing what scientists call the planet\u2019s albedo, or reflective power, will partially offset the warming effects caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.\"",

I commented asking how they could simply shrug off the deaths off so many people just because they were in a low percentage and was permanently banned and muted for asking \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you people?\u201d. I truly don\u2019t get the conservatives of that sub. I\u2019d never explored political subs too much before, and mostly figured that the insane conservatives I\u2019d see online/in the news were of a select few who were the worst of the worst. I figured that the general majority of conservatives must have at least *some* common sense about coronavirus, but upon looking at r/conservatives, I really can\u2019t find any. It\u2019s just so weird to me how these people can truly believe things like that masks suffocate you and that the death rate is low so we should all just picked up and return to work. I understand that at least one person in the world is bound to have a different outlook on a topic, but it\u2019s just really shocking to think that so many can find one thing that seems absolutely insane to me (and many others) so absolutely fine.

        "comment1": "This is a nonsensical argument.  The debt isn't coming from those payments.  It's coming from all of the other nonsense that we are spending money on.  That money isn't debt.  It's our own money the government took from us!  It doesn't create debt to give us back our own money.  Hell, it's not even all the money I paid to the government.  I've paid considerably more than $2,000 this year.  So they still have a lot of my money.  The debt is being added by the other stuff they want to do with my money, the stuff that my money and every other taxpayer's money isn't enough to cover.  That's debt.  \n\nTo put it another way, if someone took a thousand dollars from you and then gave you back 500, no debt was created.  If they took the thousand dollars from you and dedicated it to you or someone else in the future at higher dollar amount, **that** is debt if the extra money isn't funded.  If it were properly invested and then paid back, no debt.  If it were not properly invested and instead squandered on other spending projects resulting in a requirement to print money to give you your return, well, **that** is debt.\n\nBut no, giving people back $2k of their own money is not creating one dime worth of debt.  The debt is coming from the fact that the government insists on printing more money to give billions to other crap like Sudan and Egypt and museums and more.  The government could just decide to not do any of those things and give us back our money.  Then they'd not be creating a dime worth of debt.  The debt is created by them taking our money, returning it, then printing more to fund their pet projects.  To argue that giving us back our own money creates debt is saying that **we are obligated to give Sudan over half a billion dollars to our own personal detriment!**  Our government shut us down economically and hurt our finances.  Now, when it sounds as though you might get back some of your own tax money, people say it's debt on our children.  I suppose that's because they think that even in your toughest, most painful moments when you're being hurt by the government that you **still** have an obligation to be using your money to fund gender programs in Pakistan.  \n\nHow about this?  How about no, we are not obligated to pay for women's projects in Pakistan.  We are not obligated to pay for Egypt's military.  We are not obligated to fund Sudan's terrorism restitution.  We are not obligated to give money to museums that are closed due to COVID.  And instead of doing all of that stuff, you just send us back our money.  There.  No debt.  No controversy.  \n\nOr better yet, since we shouldn't be doing any of that crap in the first place, how about the government just stop taking that money from us?\n\nOne thing this bill did that is extremely productive and revealing is this... it told us all just how much in taxes the government does **not** need to be taking from us.  All of that shit in that bill is useless to us and should not be funded, so that amount of money should never leave our pockets and go to the government in the first place.  How about government just take what it needs to perform its essential functions instead of taking excess to make corrupt friendships around the world?",

        "comment1": "One issue I would raise, sorry if someone else brought this up, immigration creates an influx in the supply of labor. If the supply of a good (laborers) goes up, the cost (wages) will go down. The wage rates in this country aren\u2019t able to keep up with inflation as it is. \n\nOn the other hand, in theory, you\u2019d think a reduction in wages would mean a drop in prices because goods would be cheaper to produce. But that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes that just some executive\u2019s bonus.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201ctheir taking out jobs\u201d argument. Most the jobs they are taking a low wage jobs that Americans don\u2019t want for whatever reason. That\u2019s another discussion entirely.",
