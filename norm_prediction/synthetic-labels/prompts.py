EXAMPLE1_COMMENT2: "none, tbh. maybe increased pooping, but that could very well be coincidental."
EXAMPLE1_ANSWER: "{1}. EXAMPLE1_COMMENT1 exhibits a more formal tone compared to EXAMPLE1_COMMENT2. EXAMPLE1_COMMENT1 maintains a structured approach, using relatively complete sentences, standard capitalization, and correct punctuations. Meanwhile, EXAMPLE1_COMMENT1 is much more casual, using abbreviations (i.e. "tbh") and consistently lacking syntatic components."

Example 2: 
EXAMPLE2_COMMENT1: "Graduating college. Jeez, 25 years old."
EXAMPLE2_COMMENT2: "I get diarrhea.  I calm down in the bathroom."
EXAMPLE2_ANSWER: "{2}. EXAMPLE2_COMMENT2 is more formal compared to EXAMPLE2_COMMENT1.

EXAMPLE3_COMMENT2: "Baby, you‚Äôre the best a man can get!"
EXAMPLE3_ANSWER: "{2}. EXAMPLE3_COMMENT2 maintains a more formal tone compared to EXAMPLE3_COMMENT1. EXAMPLE3_COMMENT2 contains all syntactic components and is a complete sentence with standard capitalization, grammar, and punctuation. EXAMPLE3_COMMENT1 uses nonstandard capitalization and nonstandard components such as "*" and "god", thus creating a more casual tone."

EXAMPLE1_COMMENT2: "I üíñ Oregon when it's not on fire"

Example 3: 
EXAMPLE3_COMMENT1: "Typical engineer, classing people as "engineer" or "non-engineer" ;)"
EXAMPLE3_COMMENT2: "Ex-wife turned out to be an abusive psycopath"
EXAMPLE3_ANSWER: "{1}. EXAMPLE3_COMMENT1 is more sarcastic compared to EXAMPLE3_COMMENT2. In EXAMPLE3_COMMENT1, the tone is sarcastic and slightly mocking. By labeling the poster as a "typical engineer" and pointing out the categorization of people based on career, the commentor implies criticism of the original post's framing and categorization, which can be interpreted as dismissive.
